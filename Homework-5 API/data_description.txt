1. Based on the graph 'Latitude vs. Max Temperature (25/11/2018)', we can see that cities on low latitude have higher temperature in general.

2. On the data research day(25/11/2018), north earth is in winter, while the south part is in summer. Therefore, cities in north part are having a lower temperature in avarage at this moment comparing with the south.

3. Humidity, cloudiness and weed speed have no clear relations with latitude, which means that we may need further researches in these 3 items if we would like to find more.
