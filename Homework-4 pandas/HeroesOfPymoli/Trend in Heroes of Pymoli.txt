Trend in Heroes of Pymoli1.	The majority players of this game are male, who take about 85% in percentage of players2.	Nearly half of players (44.79%) are in the age group 20-243.	The most popular purchasing items in game also bring profit to company, as there are 3 items (Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, Nirvana, and Fiery Glass Crusader) appear in both top 5 most popular item and top 5 most profitable lists. 

	Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy appears in the top 5 most popular items. Comparing with other 4 items, it is very obviously that profit brought by Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy is much less than the other 4. So, I presume that company can increase the sell price of Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy in the next phase.
